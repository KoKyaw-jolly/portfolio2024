            <h3>Leave Application System (Web App)</h3>
            <p>
                The Leave Application System is a web-based solution designed to manage employee leave requests, holiday management, and notifications. It helps streamline the process of applying for leaves, generating reports, and keeping track of company holidays. The system is built with a focus on ease of use and efficient management for both employees and administrators.

            <h5><b>GitHub Repository</b></h5>
            <p>
                This repository contains the entire frontend of the Leave Application System built using Angular 18. It utilizes Ant Design (ng-zorro) for UI components and NgRx for state management. The project is front-end focused, and the backend is simulated using Mockoon. You can find the setup and testing instructions in the README file, which includes steps to run the mock backend.
